# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: January, 24, 2019 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Created a really quick website for my husband and I. Tricked heroku into deploying this placeholder site with an index.php file

**Thoughts:** This actually uses my portfolio as a template. we're playing a show on the 15th of February and I wanted to make sure there was a place people could go to see what we're all about.
